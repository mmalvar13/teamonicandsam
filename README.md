How Can You Help?

The problem: There are a multitude of factors that cause families and individuals to live below the poverty line in our community. Homelessness, addiction, incarceration, food scarcity, barriers to education, and unjust laws and policies just to name a few. Instead of trying tackle the entire problem at once (an overwhelming and impossible task), How Can You Help? allows civic-minded individuals to take daily, weekly, and monthly action on the urgent issues that matter most to their community.

How Can You Help? is a streamlined web application where verified organizations large and small can post urgent issues pertaining to poverty. Community members can view these posts and quickly take the action best-suited for the problem, i.e. volunteer, donate money or goods, sign a petition, attend a meeting, or call a representative.

How Can You Help? empowers communities by tapping into the existing organizational infrastructure of nonprofits, task forces, and city councils. People want to help, they often just don’t know the best way to do so. How Can You Help? allows the organizations who know most about poverty to clearly dictate the kind of action that is needed from their constituents and community members.

Individuals and families seeking assistance can also visit How Can You Help? to access a list of resources or upcoming community events
